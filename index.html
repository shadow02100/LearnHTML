			<p>First off you are going to want to open your text editor of choice, for me I'm using<br/> Sublime Text 3</p>
			<p>First off we need to know how to open and close tags. In HTML opening tags are denoted by "<img src="openingtag.png">" <br/>a Less Than Sign to open the tag, and a Greater Than Sign to close it off. Closing tags are denoted<br/> by this "<img src="closingtag.png">", notice the foward slash in there, that's what declares it as a closing tag.</p>
			<p>Now that we know how to open and close tags, we can start coding!</p>
			<p>In that text editor you are going to want to create two HTML tags, one opening<img src="HTMLOpeningTag.png"> <br/>and one closing tag<img src="HTMLClosingTag.png"> and save the file *anything*.html (you can change the anything to 
			<br/> what ever you want).</p>
			<p>These two tags tell the browser that we are in fact using HTML</p>
			<p>But we're not done yet, that is just the start of it all.</p>

			</h3>
			<p>When creating a webpage, you want to create an index file. We do this so we can easily create new files without the setup.</p>
			<p>To create an index file, we are going to make two HTML tags, and opening<img src="HTMLOpeningTag.png"> and a closing tag<img src="HTMLClosingTag.png">.</p>
			<p>Next we are going to create two head tags, one opening<img src="HeadOpeningTag.png"> and one closing<img src="HeadClosingTag.png">. Making sure to put those Head tags inside the HTML tags we made previously.</p>
			<p>If you did everything correctly so far, you should have something that looks a little like this.</p><img src="IndexProgress.png">
		</div>
		<div class="setupcont">
				<p>We're about half-way done with this index file now. Next we need two title tags, one opening<img src="TitleOpeningTag.png"> and one closing.<img src="TitleClosingTag.png"></p>
				<p>Once again if you did everything correctly it should look something like this.</p>
				<img src="IndexProgress2.png">
				<p>Lastly, we have the body tags to put, we are going to put these tags inbetween the head tag and before the closing HTML tag, just remember and opening tag<img src="BodyOpeningTag.png"> and a closing tag.<img src="BodyClosingTag.png"></p>
				<p>Once again, if everything is setup correctly, then you will have something that looks like this.<img src='IndexComplete.png'>
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="setupcont2">
			<p>Now that we have the basic setup for a webpage, save the file as index.html <b>DO NOT</b> forget the html otherwise the web browser will not know what to do with the file.</p>
